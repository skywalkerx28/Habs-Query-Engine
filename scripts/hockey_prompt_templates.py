PERFORMANCE SPLIT ANALYSIS:
The data shows performance in three contexts:
- "Below": When Montreal's ES Expected Goals For % < 50% (being out-produced by opponents)
- "Average": Overall performance across all game situations
- "Above": When Montreal's ES Expected Goals For % > 50% (out-producing opponents)

DATA CONTEXT:
