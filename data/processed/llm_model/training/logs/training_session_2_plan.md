- ✅ **Professional Standards**: Hockey terminology and communication mastered
- ✅ **Montreal Expertise**: 1,982 Canadiens-specific conversation pairs learned
- ✅ **Cost Efficiency**: $15.76 for enterprise-grade foundation

**Foundation Established:**
- Professional hockey analytics conversation patterns
- Montreal Canadiens domain expertise and terminology
- Basic analytical reasoning and insight generation
- Clean, professional communication standards (no emojis)
- AI agent development compatibility

### Session 2 Strategic Objectives

**Primary Goal**: Transform the foundational model into a sophisticated analytical orchestrator capable of seamless integration with the LangGraph + RAG + Parquet architecture.

**Core Enhancements:**
1. **Tool Orchestration Mastery** - Teach WHEN and HOW to use analytical tools
2. **Multi-Step Reasoning** - Complex analytical workflows with proper sequencing  
3. **Identity-Aware Processing** - Role-based responses (coach/player/analyst/staff)
4. **Evidence-Based Analysis** - Source attribution and data-backed insights
5. **Enterprise Error Handling** - Graceful degradation and clarification requests

### Dataset Architecture

#### Composition (Target: 2,000-2,200 Examples)

| **Category** | **Examples** | **Percentage** | **Purpose** |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Tool Integration** | 800-900 | 40% | Multi-step analytical workflows with tool coordination |
| **Multi-Turn Conversations** | 500-550 | 25% | Complex analytical discussions and follow-ups |
| **Role-Based Responses** | 400-440 | 20% | Identity-aware communication adaptation |
| **Evidence-Based Analysis** | 200-220 | 10% | Source attribution and methodological rigor |
| **Error Handling** | 100-110 | 5% | Graceful degradation and ambiguity resolution |

#### Enhanced System Prompt

The new system prompt emphasizes:
- **Tool orchestration capabilities** with explicit tool usage syntax
- **Multi-step analytical reasoning** with clear workflow demonstration
- **Role adaptation** based on user context (coach/player/analyst)
- **Evidence-based communication** with source attribution requirements
- **Professional hockey terminology** appropriate for Montreal Canadiens personnel

### Tool Integration Framework

#### Core Tools for Training
```
[TOOL: vector_search] - Hockey knowledge and strategic context
[TOOL: parquet_query] - Real-time statistics and game data  
[TOOL: calculate_advanced_metrics] - xG, Corsi, zone analysis
[TOOL: matchup_analysis] - Opponent analysis and recommendations
[TOOL: visualization] - Heatmaps and statistical displays
[TOOL: player_analysis] - Individual performance breakdowns
[TOOL: development_focus] - Training and improvement recommendations
```

#### Example Tool Orchestration Pattern
```
User Query → Step 1: [TOOL: parquet_query] → Step 2: [TOOL: calculate_advanced_metrics] → Step 3: [TOOL: matchup_analysis] → Synthesis → Evidence-Based Response
```
