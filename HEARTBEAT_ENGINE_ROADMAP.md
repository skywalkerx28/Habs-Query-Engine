## EXPECTED TRANSFORMATION

### BEFORE (Current State)
```
Query: "Where do I rank among wingers with similar ice time?"
Response: "Comparative analysis places you in the 76th percentile among similar players,
with particular strength in defensive reliability..."
Generic response, no actual data
```

### AFTER (HeartBeat Engine Complete)
```
Query: "Where do I rank among wingers with similar ice time?"
Response: "Based on your 18.3 minutes average ice time, you rank in the 76th percentile
among NHL wingers (data from 247 qualifying players). Your 2.1 goals per 60 minutes
places you 23rd among this group, while your 52.3% Corsi percentage ranks 156th.
Recent trend analysis shows 12% improvement in high-danger chances over your last 10 games,
with particularly strong performance in defensive zone exits (68.5% success rate,
84th percentile)."
Specific metrics, percentiles, trends, evidence-based analysis
```
