# HeartBeat Engine - Detailed Implementation Roadmap

## 🎯 CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS COMPLETED
- **Fine-tuned AI Model**: `ft:ministral-8b-latest:dd26ff35:20250921:5207f629` (100% test success rate)
- **Enterprise Data Foundation**: 176+ parquet files with comprehensive MTL hockey analytics
- **RAG Chunks Ready**: comprehensive_hockey_rag_chunks_2024_2025.json (573 chunks), mtl_team_stats_contextual_rag_chunks_2024_2025.json (353 chunks)
- **Hybrid Architecture**: scripts/heartbeat_engine.py framework designed
- **API Integrations**: Mistral AI + Pinecone MCP connections working

###  CRITICAL ISSUE TO SOLVE
**Problem**: Fine-tuned model provides excellent hockey terminology and conversational style, but responses lack tangible technical data, metrics, and factual references.

**Root Cause**: Model operates in isolation without access to:
1. RAG chunks (hockey context & historical knowledge)
2. Parquet query tools (real-time MTL statistics)  
3. Hybrid response synthesis (evidence-based answers)

### 🎯 SOLUTION OBJECTIVE
Transform "text-only" responses into data-driven hockey intelligence by implementing the complete HeartBeat Engine hybrid system.

#### Task 1.1: Pinecone Vector Database Setup
- [ ] **Initialize Pinecone indexes** using existing MCP connection
- [ ] **Create dual index architecture**: 
  - `habs-comprehensive-hockey` (573 general hockey chunks)
  - `habs-mtl-contextual` (353 MTL-specific chunks)
- [ ] **Configure embedding model**: Use `multilingual-e5-large` for optimal hockey terminology
- [ ] **Upload RAG chunks** with proper metadata (chunk_id, source, relevance_type)

**Deliverable**: Working Pinecone indexes with searchable hockey knowledge

#### Task 1.2: RAG Retrieval Implementation  
- [ ] **Build retrieval functions** in `scripts/heartbeat_engine.py`
- [ ] **Implement hybrid search**: semantic similarity + metadata filtering

Response: "Comparative analysis places you in the 76th percentile among similar players, 
with particular strength in defensive reliability..."
❌ Generic response, no actual data
```

### AFTER (HeartBeat Engine Complete)
```
Query: "Where do I rank among wingers with similar ice time?"
Response: "Based on your 18.3 minutes average ice time, you rank in the 76th percentile

places you 23rd among this group, while your 52.3% Corsi percentage ranks 156th. 
Recent trend analysis shows 12% improvement in high-danger chances over your last 10 games, 
with particularly strong performance in defensive zone exits (68.5% success rate, 
84th percentile)."
