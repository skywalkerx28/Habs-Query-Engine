      "question": "What are Tampa Bay's key defensive vulnerabilities we can exploit?",
      "response": "Tampa Bay Lightning's defensive system is predicated on a high-press, aggressive approach, which can create opportunities for exploitation.

We need to ensure our players understand their roles and responsibilities within our system.
